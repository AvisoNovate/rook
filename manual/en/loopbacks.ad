title: Async Loopbacks
---

Async Loopbacks are a feature of Rook that has been removed (in 0.1.18).

The intent was to leverage core.async to be able to "loop back" new requests directly
into the request pipeline, bypassing the HTTP/HTTPs portions.
The concept was discarded as it did not result in significant performance improvements,
and was an increasingly leaky abstraction.
