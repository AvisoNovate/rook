Rook is a set of middleware and handlers to enable metadata-based routing for https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] web applications.

The intention is to expose a Clojure _namespace_ as a web service _resource_; there's a default mapping of HTTP verbs
and paths to function names; these can be extended or overridden by metadata on the functions in the namespace.

The end result is that a proper web service resource can be created in very little code.

Rook works well with https://github.com/clojure/core.async[Clojure's core.async] to allow you to build richly interdependent resources
without blocking all your threads.
