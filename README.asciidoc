Rook is a set of middleware and handlers to enable metadata-based routing for https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] web applications.

The intention is to expose a Clojure _namespace_ as a web service _resource_; there's a default mapping of HTTP verbs
and paths to function names; these can be extended or overridden by metadata on the functions in the namespace.

The end result is that a compliant web service resource can be created in very little code.

Rook also supports Swagger 2.0: a detailed JSON description of your web service is generated directly from the functions and metadata.

Rook is available under the terms of the Apache Software License 2.0.
